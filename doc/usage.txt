Running

To run whole package:
	(on package) Run As -> ScalaTest - Package
	
To run single file:
	manually create run configuration of type ScalaTest, inputing class name
	automatic way described on site does not work, issue is described but without solution
	class name is not searchable in dialog, also described
	
To run single test in file:
	manually create run configuration, with test name
	how to do it in test that doesn't have name?
